/**
 * Quickselect is a selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an
 * unordered list. Like quicksort, it is efficient in practice and has good
 * average-case performance, but has poor worst-case performance. Quickselect
 * and variants is the selection algorithm most often used in efficient
 * real-world implementations.
 *
 * Quickselect uses the same overall approach as quicksort, choosing one element
 * as a pivot and partitioning the data in two based on the pivot, accordingly
 * as less than or greater than the pivot. However, instead of recursing into
 * both sides, as in quicksort, quickselect only recurses into one side â€“ the
 * side with the element it is searching for. This reduces the average
 * complexity from O(n log n) (in quicksort) to O(n) (in quickselect).
 *
 * As with quicksort, quickselect is generally implemented as an in-place
 * algorithm, and beyond selecting the kth element, it also partially sorts the
 * data. See selection algorithm for further discussion of the connection with
 * sorting.
